# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The game allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game is a draw.
